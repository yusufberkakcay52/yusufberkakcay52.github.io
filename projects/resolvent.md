# Lagrange Resolvents

The Lagrange resolvent is a method for solving cubic equations. For a given cubic polynomial, one first associates a corresponding sextic polynomial, called the Lagrange resolvent. Then, with the aid of the Lagrange resolvent, one finds the three roots of the cubic equation.

In this code, we apply this method to the cubic equation

x³ + (3/2)x² − (11/2)x − 3 = 0

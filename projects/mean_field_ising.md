# Mean Field Ising Model and Phase Transitions

The Ising model is a theoretical model that describes the phenomenon of ferromagnetism within the framework of statistical mechanics. One of the methods used to solve the Ising model is the so-called mean-field approximation. This approximation leads to the self-consistency equation

m = tanh(βJzm).

According to this equation, one expects a phase transition at T=T_c=zJ/k_B. This code studies the solutions of this equation and verifies the existence of a phase transition.

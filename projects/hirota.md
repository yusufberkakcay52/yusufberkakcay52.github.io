# Hirota Bilinear Form

In this code, we examine some properties of the Hirota derivative. First, we find an explicit formula for D_x^n{f, g}. After that, we show that the KdV equation

u_xxx + 6 u u_x + u_y = 0

can be written in the bilinear form

(D_y D_x + D_x^4){t, t} = 0,

where u = 2 (log t)_xx.

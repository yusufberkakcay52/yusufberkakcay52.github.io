# Approximation of the Absolute Value Function

In this code, we define a recurrence relation for a sequence of polynomials. One can show that this sequence converges to the absolute value function, so it can be used to approximate it. We check this fact for the first few polynomials.

This is, in fact, a consequence of a more general result known as the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem.

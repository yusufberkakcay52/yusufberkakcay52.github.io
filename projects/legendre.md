# Legendre Transformation

The Legendre transformation is a mathematical tool that relates Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, as well as different thermodynamic potentials such as enthalpy and free energy. Thus, it has great theoretical and practical importance.

This code calculates the Legendre transformation of a given function. Several examples are included in the code.

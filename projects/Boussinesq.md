# A Derivation for the Boussinesq Equation

This code shows a derivation of the Boussinesq equation. This equation is of great interest since it leads to an integrable system.

We derive the Boussinesq equation by means of an isospectral problem. We consider the isospectral problem of a general third-order differential operator 𝐿 under a Schrödinger-like evolution operator 
𝐴, which leads us to the Boussinesq equation.

This codes shows a derivation of the Boussinesq equation. This equation is of great interest since it leads to an integrable system.

We derive the Boussinesq equation by means of an isospectral problem. We consider isospectral problem of the general third order differential operator L under the Schrödinger like evolution operator A, which leads us to the Boussinesq equation.

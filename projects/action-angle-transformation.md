This code constructs the action–angle variables (J, θ) for the
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and verifies that the transformation
(q, p) → (J, θ) is canonical.

To check this, we compute the Poisson bracket {θ, J}.
As expected, the result is {θ, J} = 1,
confirming that (J, θ) form a canonical pair.

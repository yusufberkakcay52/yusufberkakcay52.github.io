Action–Angle Variables for the Harmonic Oscillator

This code constructs the Action-Angle variables (J,\theta) for Harmonic Oscillator and verifies the transformation (p,q) -> (J,\theta) is a canonical transformation. 
To verify this, we compute {\theta,J} and as expected, we get {\theta,J}=1. This confirms that the transformation (p,q) -> (J,\theta) is a canonical transformation.
